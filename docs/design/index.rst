Library Design
==============

Key Ideas:

    * Custom composed excel documents require a markdown capability to design and update
    * HTML is an exceptional markdown language for this:
        * Native support for styling of blocks of content
        * Commonly understood semantics for basic tags
        * syntax for adding style and attributes to blocks
        * Existing templating dialects
        * Extremely good support for table design
    * Templating languages exist to dynamically generate HTML from data
